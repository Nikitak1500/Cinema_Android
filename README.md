Mobile application for purchasing cinema tickets â€“ Created as part of a large team project at the university. It included both familiar technologies and new ones. Google OAuth was used for user authentication. The PayPal payment API was also used in the development of the application. I learned how to work with authentication and set up payment. It was interesting to work in a team on a part of a large project.
